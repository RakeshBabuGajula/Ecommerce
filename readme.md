# E-commerce Website Project

This is a simple and responsive *E-commerce website* built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*, designed to simulate a real online shopping experience. The project includes multiple product pages, category navigation, a working cart page using localStorage, and a clean, modern UI.

## ðŸš€ Project Purpose

This is *not part of any internship or official assignment* â€” I built this project purely to *sharpen my front-end development skills*, explore UI/UX layout strategies, and understand basic e-commerce functionalities from scratch.
